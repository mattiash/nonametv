Installing NonameTV
-------------------

PREREQUISITES

MySQL-server, at least version 4.0. This is necessary since transactions
are used. The MySQL-server must be configured with support for InnoDB
tables.

A lot of perl-modules... You will find out which ones along the way.

wvHtml from http://wvware.sourceforge.net/

sitecopy from http://www.lyra.org/sitecopy/

INSTALLATION

Create a new mysql database called listings.

Create tables in the database and populate them with tables by running the
commands in examples/listings.sql. Then populate the channels and trans_cat
tables with data from examples/channels.txt and trans_cat.txt. This can be
done with the following MySQL commands:

LOAD DATA INFILE 'channels.txt' INTO TABLE channels
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"';

LOAD DATA INFILE 'trans_cat.txt' INTO TABLE trans_cat
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"';

Create a directory called /var/local/nonametv.

Create the following directories under /var/local/nonametv:

cache
channels
xmltv
xmltv_staging
xmltv_compare
data
override
override/data
override/delete
override/new
xmltv_old

Also create a directory /var/log/nonametv/

Make sure that the user you intend to run the scripts as can read/write the
directories above.

Copy examples/nonametv.conf.public to /etc/nonametv.conf. Note that this file
only contains configuration for the Importers that can be run without passwords
etc. from the TV-companies.

Edit /etc/nonametv.conf to match your installation.

Setup sitecopy to upload files from /var/local/nonametv/xmltv to your
webserver. This is the data that is downloaded by tv_grab_se_swedb.

Explore the commands in tools/ and tools/se. Start by looking at 
tools/se/nonametv-cronjob.

The only command that isn't run from nonametv-cronjob is

perl -I lib tools/nonametv-export Xmltv --export-channels

(run from the nonametv-directory). It creates the channels.xml.gz file and
should be run after you have added new channels or deleted old.

Most of the commands take one or several --verbose parameters.

Note that not all commands in tools/ are actually working...

Everytime data is imported or exported, an entry is written to 
/var/log/nonametv/nonametv.log.
